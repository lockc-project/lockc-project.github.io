# libvirt

## Configure libvirt
  
VMs which we are going to run are using 9p to mount the source tree. To
ensure that those mounts are going to work correctly, open the
`/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf` file and ensure that the following options
are present there:

```bash
user = "root"
group = "root"
dynamic_ownership = 0
```
If you had to edit the configuration, save the file and restart libvirt:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart libvirtd
```

## Running VMs

Now it's time to prepare Terraform environment. Terraform files are included in
the main lockc git repository.

```bash
cd contrib/terraform/libvirt
cp terraform.tfvars.json.example terraform.tfvars.json
```

After that, open the `terraform.tfvars.json` file with your favorite text
editor. The only setting which you really need to change is
`authorized_keys`. Please paste your public SSH key there. Otherwise,
connecting to VMs with SSH will be impossible.

By default, the `enable_k8s_containerd` option is `true` which means that
Kubernetes cluster with CRI containerd is going to be deployed on VMs.

If you want to rather use lockc with Docker as a local container engine, set
`enable_k8s_containerd` to `false` and set `enable_docker` to `true`. In that
case, it also makes sense to set `control_planes` to `1` and `workers` to `0`,
since one VM is enough for non-clusterized Docker.

Other customization available through `terraform.tfvars.json` are explained
further in this document.

After setting the options, initialize the environment with:

```bash
terraform init
```

And then start the VMs:

```bash
terraform apply
```

 Terraform finished successfully, you should see the output with IP
addresses of virtual machines, like:

```bash
Apply complete! Resources: 31 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

ip_control_planes = {
  "lockc-control-plane-0" = tolist([
    "10.16.0.113",
  ])
  "lockc-control-plane-1" = tolist([
    "10.16.0.137",
  ])
}
ip_workers = {
  "lockc-worker-0" = tolist([
    "10.16.0.174",
  ])
  "lockc-worker-1" = tolist([
    "10.16.0.44",
  ])
}

```

You can simply ssh to them using the `opensuse` user:

```bash
ssh opensuse@10.16.0.255
```

## Kubernetes

If you chose to deploy Kubernetes, there will be the `admin.conf` file
available after successful run of terraform. You can use it by doing:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/admin.conf
```

Then we can check whether Kubernetes is running properly:

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes

```

Now it's time to build and deploy lockc!

To build lockc container image, we have to go to the main directory in lockc
git repository:

```bash
# Go to the main directory of lockc sources
cd ../../..
export IMAGE_NAME=$(uuidgen)
docker build -t ttl.sh/${IMAGE_NAME}:30m .
docker push ttl.sh/${IMAGE_NAME}:30m
```

Then we need to go to the helm-charts git repository:

```bash
# Go to the main directory of helm-charts sources
cd ../helm-charts
kubectl apply -f https://lockc-project.github.io/helm-charts/namespace.yaml
helm install lockc charts/lockc/ --namespace lockc \
    --set lockcd.image.repository=ttl.sh/${IMAGE_NAME} \
    --set lockcd.image.tag=30m \
    --set lockcd.log.level=debug
```

Then wait until the `lockcd` DaemonSet is ready:

```bash
$ kubectl -n lockc get ds lockcd
NAME     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
lockcd   4         4         4       4            4           <none>          42s
```

You can check further whether lockc is working properly by using example
deployments. Some of them (not violating policies) should deploy successfully.
The other ones (violating policies) should fail.

Let's start with creating namespaces which enforce particular policy levels:

```bash
$ cd examples/kubernetes
$ kubectl apply -f namespaces.yaml 
namespace/restricted created
namespace/baseline created
namespace/privileged created
```

Then let's deploy examples which should run successfully:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f deployments-should-succeed.yaml 
deployment.apps/nginx-default-success created
deployment.apps/nginx-restricted-success created
deployment.apps/nginx-baseline-success created
deployment.apps/bpf-privileged-success created
$ kubectl get pods -A | grep success
baseline      nginx-baseline-success-8f5dd55f5-8cn9v          1/1     Running   0             17s
default       nginx-default-success-54df89d4ff-582dz          1/1     Running   0             17s
privileged    bpf-privileged-success-5f6b5975b6-hw6h5         1/1     Running   0             17s
restricted    nginx-restricted-success-57b757d5df-btr2s       1/1     Running   0             17s
```

And then examples which should fail:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f deployments-should-fail.yaml 
deployment.apps/nginx-restricted-fail created
deployment.apps/bpf-default-fail created
deployment.apps/bpf-restricted-fail created
deployment.apps/bpf-baseline-fail created
$ kubectl get pods -A | grep fail
baseline      bpf-baseline-fail-756b89d76f-gzqzq              0/1     CrashLoopBackOff    5 (17s ago)   3m22s
default       bpf-default-fail-7d767947c7-dvjmt               0/1     RunContainerError   5 (9s ago)    3m22s
restricted    bpf-restricted-fail-7789944bc5-777tq            0/1     CrashLoopBackOff    5 (21s ago)   3m22s
restricted    nginx-restricted-fail-74fb56bb7-vllkx           0/1     ContainerCreating   0             3m22s
```

We can dig deeper to check for the reason of failure:

```bash
$ kubectl describe pod bpf-default-fail-7d767947c7-dvjmt
[...]
      Message:      failed to create containerd task: failed to create shim: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: process_linux.go:545: container init caused: rootfs_linux.go:76: mounting "/sys/fs/bpf" to rootfs at "/sys/fs/bpf" caused: mount through procfd: operation not permitted: unknown
[...]
```

After connecting to one of the VMs we can use bpftool to check lockc BPF
programs:

```bash
$ ssh opensuse@10.16.0.174
$ sudo -i
# bpftool prog list

[...]
```

And whether it registers containers. Directories inside
`/sys/fs/bpf/lockc` represent timestamps of lockcd launch, so it will be
different than in the following example.

```bash
# bpftool map dump pinned /sys/fs/bpf/lockc/1637160542/map_containers 
[{
        "key": 4257,
        "value": {
            "policy_level": "POLICY_LEVEL_BASELINE"
        }
    },{
        "key": 4780,
        "value": {
            "policy_level": "POLICY_LEVEL_BASELINE"
        }
    },{
        "key": 4664,
        "value": {
            "policy_level": "POLICY_LEVEL_RESTRICTED"
        }
    },{
        "key": 4589,
        "value": {
            "policy_level": "POLICY_LEVEL_BASELINE"
        }
    },{
        "key": 4422,
        "value": {
            "policy_level": "POLICY_LEVEL_RESTRICTED"
        }
    }
]
```

## Docker

Terraform output in case of Docker should look like:

```bash
Apply complete! Resources: 9 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

ip_control_planes = {
  "lockc-control-plane-0" = tolist([
    "10.16.0.152",
  ])
}
ip_workers = {}
```

We can simply ssh to the VM:

```bash
ssh opensuse@10.16.0.152
```

And then try to run some insecure container:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it -v /:/rootfs registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/toolbox:latest bash
docker: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: process_linux.go:545: container init caused: rootfs_linux.go:76: mounting "/" to rootfs at "/rootfs" caused: mount through procfd: operation not permitted: unknown.
```

lockc should prevent that container from running. However, running such
container as root with `privileged` policy level should be fine:

```bash
$ sudo -i
# docker run --label org.lockc.policy=privileged --rm -it -v /:/rootfs registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/toolbox:latest bash
8ea310609fce:/ # 
```
